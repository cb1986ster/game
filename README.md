django-simple game

A singleplayer game using the Django framework.

What do I need first?

Nothing much, just Python 3+ and (ideally) virtualenv.

How do I start it?

Clone the repo, cd to the repo directory then run (again, ideally inside a virtualenv):

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python manage.py migrate

$ python manage.py runserver
